If you wish to adjust the duplicate transaction window for transactions submitted from your software, such as a website or shopping cart, you may do so by adding the field &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; to your website script.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;If you are unable to adjust or add this variable to your shopping cart settings, please contact your shopping cart support team for additional assistance in this regard. The variable &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; tells us, in seconds, how much time we should check for duplicates after a transaction is submitted.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;The largest value we will accept for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is 28800, which equals eight hours. If a value greater than 28800 sent, the payment gateway will default to 28800. If &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is set to 0 or to a negative number, no duplicate transaction window will be enforced for your software&amp;#x27;s transactions. If no value is sent, the default value of 120 (two minutes) would be used.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;For example, if you wished to set a duplicate transaction window of five minutes (&amp;#x3D; 300 seconds) you would set &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; to 300.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: By submitting &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; with your online transactions, we will return further details along with this error response, including:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul class&amp;#x3D;&amp;quot;graydot&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The original transaction ID that was duplicated;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;AVS and CVV responses for the original transaction;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The original authorization code, if the transaction was authorized;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The MD5 hash, if a MD5 hash value was generated for the original transaction.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you do not submit the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;duplicateWindow&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; field, we will not return any details from the original transaction, even if you submit a duplicate transaction.",
